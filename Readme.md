Designing a blogging platform with TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Redis, Kafka (optional), Docker, Kubernetes, Winston, Prometheus, Grafana, Terraform, and testing ensures a modern, scalable, and maintainable system. Below is the detailed design plan:

# Design a Blogging Platform with TypeScript and Modern Tools

## Problem Statement
Create a multi-user blogging platform where writers can publish blogs, manage their publications, and readers can discover, search, and read blogs. The system should scale effectively, be fault-tolerant, and provide a smooth user experience for both writers and readers.

---

## Requirements

### Core Requirements
- Writers can **publish**, **edit**, and **delete** blogs.
- Blogs can include text and images (no video).
- Readers can browse, search, and read blogs.
- Display the count of blogs published by each writer on their profile.
- Ensure **low latency** while reading blogs.
- Scale to handle **5 million daily active readers** and **10,000 daily active writers**.

### High-Level Requirements
- Ensure **high availability** and **durability** of data.
- Plan for **horizontal scaling** for both readers and writers.
- Optimize for **cost-effectiveness** while maintaining performance.
- Provide robust **logging and monitoring** for system health.
- Use **caching** to improve read operations.

### Micro Requirements
- Maintain **consistency** across the database.
- Avoid **deadlocks** or performance degradation due to database locks.
- Define system throughput under different load conditions.

---

## Architecture and Design

### High-Level Architecture
The system will be divided into multiple services with clear separation of concerns:

1. **User Service**:
   - Handles user authentication, profiles, and roles (reader/writer).
   - Integrates with JWT for secure session management.

2. **Blog Service**:
   - Manages CRUD operations for blogs.
   - Handles blog search functionality using a full-text search index (PostgreSQL or Elasticsearch).

3. **Cache Service**:
   - Redis for caching frequently accessed blogs and search queries.

4. **Event Service** (Optional):
   - Kafka for handling asynchronous events like analytics, notifications, and indexing (if scaling needs arise).

5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Winston for structured logging.
   - Prometheus for metrics collection.
   - Grafana for visualization and alerts.

6. **Infrastructure**:
   - Docker for containerization.
   - Kubernetes for orchestration.
   - Terraform for infrastructure provisioning (optional for cloud deployment).

### Database Schema

#### Tables
1. **Users**:
   - `id` (UUID, PK)
   - `name` (string)
   - `email` (string, unique)
   - `role` (enum: reader, writer)
   - `created_at`, `updated_at` (timestamps)

2. **Blogs**:
   - `id` (UUID, PK)
   - `title` (string)
   - `content` (text)
   - `author_id` (FK to Users)
   - `created_at`, `updated_at` (timestamps)

3. **Images**:
   - `id` (UUID, PK)
   - `url` (string)
   - `blog_id` (FK to Blogs)

4. **Search Cache** (Redis):
   - Key: Blog ID or Query String
   - Value: Blog content or search results

### Folder Structure

```
/src
¿¿¿ /config         # Configuration files (env variables, database)
¿¿¿ /controllers    # Route handlers
¿¿¿ /middlewares    # Authentication, validation, and error handlers
¿¿¿ /models         # Prisma models
¿¿¿ /repositories   # Database operations
¿¿¿ /routes         # API route definitions
¿¿¿ /services       # Business logic
¿¿¿ /utils          # Utility functions
¿¿¿ /cache          # Redis integration
¿¿¿ /events         # Kafka producers/consumers
¿¿¿ /tests          # Unit and integration tests
¿¿¿ /logs           # Winston logs
```

## Prototype Details

### Interfaces
1. **Writer Interface**:
   - Create, update, delete blogs.
   - View published blogs and analytics.

2. **Reader Interface**:
   - Browse blogs.
   - Search blogs by title or author.

### API Endpoints
1. **Authentication**:
   - `POST /auth/login` - User login.
   - `POST /auth/register` - User registration.

2. **Blog Management**:
   - `POST /blogs` - Create blog.
   - `GET /blogs/:id` - Read blog.
   - `PUT /blogs/:id` - Update blog.
   - `DELETE /blogs/:id` - Delete blog.

3. **Search**:
   - `GET /search` - Search blogs by query.

---

## Monitoring and Logging

- **Prometheus**:
  - Metrics: API response time, DB query performance, cache hit rate.
- **Grafana**:
  - Dashboards: Active users, blog views, error rates.
- **Winston**:
  - Log levels: Info (user actions), Warning (slow queries), Error (failures).

---

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Test services and utilities using Jest.
- **Integration Tests**: Test API routes using Supertest.
- **Load Testing**: Use tools like Apache JMeter or k6 for simulating load.

---

## Additional Notes

### Kafka: Is It Necessary?
Kafka can be added for scalability, handling asynchronous tasks like:
- Analytics event ingestion.
- Notification systems (e.g., "Your blog is trending!").
- Real-time search index updates.

### Terraform: Do We Need It?
Terraform is useful for cloud infrastructure management, especially for:
- Setting up cloud resources (e.g., AWS RDS, EC2).
- Managing infrastructure as code.

---

## Outcome

- **Learning**:
  - Database schema design.
  - Scalable API architecture.
  - Hands-on with Redis, Docker, Kubernetes.
  - Setting up monitoring and observability.
- **Prototype**:
  - A functional blogging platform.
